      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Mathematics is the study of patterns, structures, and relationships
        using logic and abstract reasoning. From arithmetic and algebra to
        calculus and geometry, students in this field explore the fundamental
        principles that underpin the universe and solve complex problems across
        various disciplines. Mathematics provides a powerful toolkit for
        modeling real-world phenomena, making predictions, and formulating
        solutions to challenges in science, engineering, economics, and beyond.
        Through rigorous analysis and problem-solving, students develop critical
        thinking skills and quantitative literacy essential for success in both
        academic and professional pursuits.
