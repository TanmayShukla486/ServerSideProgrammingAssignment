      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Civics is the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens
        within a society and the functioning of governmental systems at local,
        national, and global levels. Students in this field explore topics such
        as democracy, citizenship, political institutions, and public policy,
        gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that shape civic life
        and governance structures. Through critical analysis and engagement with
        contemporary issues, students develop the knowledge and skills necessary
        to actively participate in civic affairs and contribute to the
        democratic process.
