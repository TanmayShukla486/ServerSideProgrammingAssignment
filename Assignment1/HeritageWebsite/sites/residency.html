        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          British Residency may not be one of the best preserved monuments in
          Lucknow, but it is undeniably an important part of its history. Hence,
          a must visit for every history buff during a Lucknow trip. In 1857,
          when the city found itself at one of the major centres of rebellion
          uprisings against the cruel British rule, this place became home to
          about 3000 British people.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The complex in itself is made decades older than that. It was actually
          built in the latter half of the 18th century to provide accommodation
          to the British guests of the regional rulers. Owing to its intriguing
          past and the crucial role it played in the cityâ€™s history, it has been
          declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India
          (ASI).
