        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Do not let the name fool you. Chota Imambara is not at all small, and
          certainly has no less touristy appeal than any other tourist place in
          and near Lucknow. Also referred to as Hussainabad Imambara, it was
          built between 1837 and 1842, about four decades after the completion
          of Bara Imambara. Its gilded dome, turrets and intricate calligraphy
          evokes a “wow” on every sight

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          It was built per the orders of Muhammad Ali Shah, the third ruler of
          Lucknow, who today, along with the several members of his family,
          rests in tombs within the imambara itself. Mughals, during their
          centuries-long reign over most parts of the Indian subcontinent
          erected a plethora of buildings that are present even today. However,
          Chota Imambara has to be one of the most magnificent structures any
          Mughal emperor ever built in India. So, do not skip this place during
          your city tour in Lucknow.
