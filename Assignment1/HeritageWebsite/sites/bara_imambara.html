        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Ask any local about the best point of interest in Lucknow to kick-off
          a city tour and most of them will suggest Bara Imambara. That’s how
          culturally and historically significant and famed this place is. The
          first important thing to know about it, which you may also have
          guessed from its name, is that it is huge. And, the second one is that
          it is absolutely stunning. The construction of this wondrous piece of
          architecture is said to have started in 1785 when Awadh and its
          surrounding areas where hit by a devastating famine. Thus, for the
          purpose of offering employment to locals in this time of need, the
          ruler of the region ordered that this structure to be built. The
          construction went on for as long as the famine lasted, which is almost
          a decade. Another intriguing fact about this place is that its central
          hall is believed by many to be the world’s largest vaulted chamber.
          Shahi Baoli and Bhool-Bhulaiyan are among its highlights.

          innovation of the time.
