        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          The best thing about the monuments of Lucknow is their diversity as
          these are built as per not just one or two, but several styles of
          architecture from all over the world. While the above monuments
          reflected Mughal, Hindu, European and other styles, Dilkusha Kothi is
          here to show you the magnificence of the Baroque style of
          architecture.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Saadat Ali Khan, during his rule in the 19th century, constructed this
          building, which is a complete replica of Seaton Delavel, an English
          country house built in 1721. The sprawling greenery surrounding the
          edifice adds to its charm.
