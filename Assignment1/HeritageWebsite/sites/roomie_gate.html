        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          When you make your way to Bara Imambara, stop for at least a few
          minutes at Rumi Darwaza. It is one of the finest pieces of
          architecture in the city of Lucknow. It is believed to be identical to
          a structure that once stood in the city of Constantinople in Turkey
          during the ancient times. Thus, the 60 feet tall structure is also
          often referred to as Turkish Gate.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          In the olden days, it marked as the entrance to the Old Lucknow city,
          but today it stands as the symbol of the city. It is one of the many
          structures that were built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during the famine of
          the late 18th century to help the locals. If you want to capture the
          best sights of this giant structure, then visit during the night when
          it looks absolutely gorgeous.
