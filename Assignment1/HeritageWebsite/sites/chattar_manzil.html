        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Another testament to the storied past of the city is Chattar Manzil.
          The building derives its name from its most prominent feature which is
          an umbrella-shaped dome at its top. Another highlight of this place is
          its architecture which shows glimpses of various styles. The most
          apparent one of these is the European style which can be witnessed in
          the numerous features of the building.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, a former Nawab of the region, is the one who is
          said to have begun the construction of the complex. However, the
          monarch died before it could be completed. It was then Nasir-ud-Din
          Haider, his son who took the charge and finished the project. Today,
          it has been turned into a government office, although its old charm is
          still a treat for the eyes.
