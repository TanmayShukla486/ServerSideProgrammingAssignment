        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Kaiserbagh Palace Complex is one of the hidden gems of Lucknow which
          is often skipped by tourists for the more prominent ones. Though much
          of it is in a dilapidated state, it still offers a glimpse into the
          royal lifestyle of the past monarchs of the region. The construction
          of the several buildings of the complex started on the orders of Nawab
          Wajid Ali Shah in the year 1848. After the completion, the buildings
          that flank the three sides of the Kaiserbagh quadrangle were turned
          into quarters for the women of Wajid Ali Shah’s harem.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Although there are several structures in the complex that are quite
          impressive, the one that stands out is the splendid Safed Baradari – a
          marvel built with white stone. You might also be surprised to learn
          the fact that this building situated at the centre of the complex was
          once paved with silver.
