        <p>
          Saadat Ali Khan was a Nawab of Awadh. Today, he rests in his tomb
          which appeases one and all with its architecture. Though it is not a
          giant edifice, but still it is one of the best preserved monuments in
          Lucknow. It is located in a neighbourhood which is home to numerous
          monuments, a few of which are Safed Baradari, Chattar Manzil and
          Kaiserbagh Palace. Thus, you get the opportunity to explore several
          points of interest in one outing.
